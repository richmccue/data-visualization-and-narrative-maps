# Narrative Maps with StoryMap JS
StoryMap JS is a web-based tool for creating narrative maps. You can use traditional cartographical maps (such as road maps) using the regular StoryMap format. You can also use images of historical maps or any other images using the Gigapixel Map feature. The instructions below take you through the process of creating a StoryMap. The sample project shown below can be found at [this link](http://bit.ly/2UtMoh5){:target="_blank"}.

1. Go to [StoryMap](https://storymap.knightlab.com/){:target="_blank"} and click the green Make a StoryMap button.

2. Sign in with your Google account. If you need to create one go [here](https://accounts.google.com/){:target="_blank"} 

3. Click the green **New** button, then enter a title for your StoryMap. Click the green **Create** button.

4. To add your first location, click on **Add Slide** in the far left column.

5. Once you have done this, a red box will appear on the map, prompting you to add your first location.  You can enter either the name of a location e.g. “St. John’s Newfoundland” or its latitude/longitude coordinates in the following format: **lat:<123.31°W>, lon:<48.46°N>**<br>
Note: To get the degree symbol use Alt+0 for Mac and Ctrl+0176 (make sure number lock is on!) for Windows.

      - Background Colour: Use the colour wheel to adjust the background colour 
      - Image: To add an image from your computer click **Choose File**. <img src="images/storymap-05.png" style="float:right;width:150px" alt="Image as marker"> Alternatively, paste a URL link to an online photo. Right-click on the desired photo and select **Copy Image Address**, and then paste into the text box beneath **Background image**. 

8. To review your changes, click **Preview** at the top of the page. 

9. To continue making your “journey”, repeat steps 5-8 for each place you would like to highlight and stop at. Bed sure to save your work frequently!
