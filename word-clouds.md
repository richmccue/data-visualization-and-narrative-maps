# Word Clouds with Word Art
Word clouds are data visualizations that display words in a given dataset, sized according to frequency: the more frequent a word is, the larger it is. WordArt is a free, web-based app for creating word clouds.

If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this in-class exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.  Have fun!
