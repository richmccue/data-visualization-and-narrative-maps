# Processing Images for Juxtapose JS

Juxtapose JS is a free, open source, web-based tool that lets you compare two media objects either images or gifs. For the best results, the two images should have points of visual similarity. A comparison of the same building at different points of time work well, for example, or a comparison of a painting before and after restoration. 

This worksheet outlines how to edit two image files in Google Sheets so they can be used most effectively in Juxtapose. The example can be viewed [here](https://goo.gl/54Ww2u)
