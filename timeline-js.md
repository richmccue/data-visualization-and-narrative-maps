# TimeLine JS

TimeLine JS is a free web-based tool for creating narrative timelines. Timelines can include media like photos, and are created using Google Sheets. The instructions below take you through the process of creating a TimeLine. Take a look at this sample TimeLine JS project which is a [timeline of building construction on campus at UVic](https://bit.ly/2W5LvBO){:target="_blank"}.

2. Determine what topic you will use for your timeline, keeping in mind that you will need easy access to images and dates for your topic.
- We encourage you to create a timeline of a topic of interest to you, but if you don't have access to photos or dates relating to your topic, you can making a timeline using the provided photos of your favourite UVic buildings from the [Victoria Modern website](http://uvac.uvic.ca/Architecture_Exhibits/UVic_campus/){:target="_blank"}. 
- The examples in the rest of this activity will use images and dates from the Victoria Modern website.

3. <img src="images/timeline-template.png" style="float:right;width:300px;" alt="Copy the Google Sheets template">Your Timeline will be built from the data you enter into a pre-formatted Google Spreadsheet. To create a spreadsheet, copy the template provided for you by clicking on the **Get the Spreaqdsheet Template** button. 

4. If prompted, sign into your Google account. If you need a Google account, make one at [accounts.google.com](https://accounts.google.com){:target="_blank"}. Click **Make a Copy** when prompted.

5. Change the title of the spreadsheet to match your project. If you are using the provided imaages and dates, you might want to name your spreadsheet, "**UVic Buildings Over Time**."

6. In the Google Spreadhseet, create a title slide by entering a headline, text and media into row 2 of the spreadsheet. Do not add dates to this slide. In column P, select **title** to set this as the title slide.
