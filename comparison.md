# Introduction to Comparison Visualizations with Juxtapose JS

Juxtapose JS is a free, open-source media comparison tool developed by Knight Lab. It allows you  to compare two images or gifs using a slider. Example projects can be viewed [her](https://goo.gl/KTswQq){:target="_blank"} and [here](https://goo.gl/awt47y){:target="_blank"} (gifs).
